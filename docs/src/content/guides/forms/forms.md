# Reactable Forms

Reactive forms with reactables. What fun is state management without forms?

Reactable Forms API took its inspiration from [Angular Forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms) but has functional reactive programming style. State is managed with reducers inside reactables vs class based form controls.
