# Core Concepts

- Reactable Interface
  [state$, action]

  - encapsulates all the logi encourages separation of concerns
    - business logic not tightly coupled with your view and can be developed and tested independently

- Reactable primitive
 - hub & store
 - scoped effects

- Composition with Reactables

  - Organizing state into slices is sensible when it grows and becomes more complex.Reactable primitives which can combine together to make bigger ones (BETTER way of saying this)

- One directional flow and explicity dependencies
  - more stuff here
