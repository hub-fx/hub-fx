# Introduction

A simple, scalable and framework-agnostic state management that improves the UI development experience for all. 

Reactables leverages reactive/declarative patterns to allow you to spend less time on the **how** and more time on **what** you want to achieve in your buisness logic.

Whether your managing application (global) state or component (local) state, Reactables provides a simple consistent pattern for handling both.
