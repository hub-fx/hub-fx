# Introduction

A simple, scalable and framework-agnostic state management that improves the UI development experience for all. 

Reactables leverages RxJS and reactive/declarative patterns to allow more time to focus on **what** you want to achieve in your buisness logic and save time on **how** it will be implemented.

Whether your managing application (global) state or component (local) state, Reactables provides a simple consistent pattern for handling both.
