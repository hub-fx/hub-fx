# Introduction

Simple, scalable and framework-agnostic state management that improves the UI development experience for all.

Reactables leverages RxJS and reactive/declarative patterns to allow more time to **focus on what** you want to achieve in your buisness logic and **save time on how** it is implemented.

Managing application (global) state or component (local) state? Reactables provides a simple consistent pattern for handling both.
